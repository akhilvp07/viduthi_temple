            50 years ago, our temple serves as a beacon of hope and tranquility for all who seek spiritual enlightenment and
            connection. Nestled in a serene environment, the temple offers a sanctuary where devotees and visitors can
            experience the divine presence of Lord Ulakudaya Perumal, seeking solace, guidance, and blessings for their journey
            in life.

            The temple is renowned for its rich history, with a vibrant tradition of rituals, festivals, and cultural
            celebrations
            that bring the community together. Our temple hosts daily prayers, weekly gatherings, and annual events, all
            designed to
            nurture the spiritual well-being of every individual. These practices offer a deep connection to our roots and
            provide a

            welcome to experience the transformative power of faith and togetherness.

            the wisdom of ancient scriptures and teachings. These programs are open to people of all ages, fostering a sense of
            community and encouraging lifelong learning. Through these teachings, we aim to help individuals deepen their
            understanding of the divine and apply spiritual principles in their daily lives.
